    <h2>The story</h2>
    <blockquote cite="https://wellsbaum.blog/2018/01/27/alan-watts-the-story-of-the-chinese-farmer/">
        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            around
            to commiserate. They said, <br><q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q><br>
            The
            farmer said, <br><q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q><br>
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the
            evening
            everybody came back and said, <br><q class="villagers">Oh, isn't that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
                horses!</q><br>
            The farmer again said, <br><q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q></p>
        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
            leg.
            The neighbors then said, <br><q class="villagers">Oh dear, that's too
                <i class="bad">bad</i>
                ,</q><br> and the farmer responded, <br><q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q><br>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his
            son
            because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <br><q class="villagers">Isn't that great!</q><br> Again,
            he
            said, <br><q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong>.</q>
        </p>

        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it's really impossible to
            tell
            whether anything that happens in it is
            <i class="good">good</i>
            or
            <i class="bad">bad</i>
            <br> because you never know what will be the consequence of the
            misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of
            <i class="good">good</i>
            fortune.
        </p>

        <i class="good"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good" title="What is good?" class="good">good</a></i>
        and

        are just one perspective. Bananas are
